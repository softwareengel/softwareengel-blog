# Java Jsprit Routing
jsprit is a java based, open source toolkit for solving rich Traveling Salesman Problems(TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problems(VRP). It is lightweight, flexible and easy-to-use, and based on a single all-purpose meta-heuristic currently solving

    Capacitated VRP
    Multiple Depot VRP
    VRP with Time Windows
    VRP with Backhauls
    VRP with Pickups and Deliveries
    VRP with Heterogeneous Fleet
    Time-dependent VRP
    Traveling Salesman Problem
    Dial-a-Ride Problem
    Various combination of these types

Setting up the problem, defining additional constraints, modifying the algorithms and visualising the discovered solutions is as easy and handy as reading classical VRP instances to benchmark your algorithm. It is fit for change and extension due to a modular design and a comprehensive set of unit and integration-tests. More features ...

The jsprit-project is maintained by GraphHopper.
