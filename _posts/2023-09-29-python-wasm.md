- **Code Consoles**: Code consoles enable you to run code interactively in a kernel. The cells of a code console show the order in which code was executed in the kernel, as opposed to the explicit ordering of cells in a notebook document. Code consoles also display rich output, just like notebook cells. <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/code_console.html>
