# OmniAuth: Standardized Multi-Provider Authentication in Ruby

OmniAuth is a library that standardizes multi-provider authentication for web applications. It was created to be powerful, flexible, and do as little as possible. Any developer can create strategies for OmniAuth that can authenticate users via disparate systems. OmniAuth strategies have been created for everything from Facebook to LDAP.

In order to use OmniAuth in your applications, you will need to leverage one or more strategies. These strategies are generally released individually as RubyGems, and you can see a community maintained list on the wiki for this project.

One strategy, called Developer, is included with OmniAuth and provides a completely insecure, non-production-usable strategy that directly prompts a user for authentication information and then passes it straight through. You can use it as a placeholder when you start development and easily swap in other strategies later.
