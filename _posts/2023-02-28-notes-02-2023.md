# Wasm compiler Emscripten 

Emscripten is a complete Open Source compiler toolchain to WebAssembly. Using Emscripten you can:

Compile C and C++ code, or any other language that uses LLVM, into WebAssembly, and run it on the Web, Node.js, or other wasm runtimes.

Compile the C/C++ runtimes of other languages into WebAssembly, and then run code in those other languages in an indirect way (for example, this has been done for Python and Lua).

Practically any portable C or C++ codebase can be compiled into WebAssembly using Emscripten, ranging from high-performance games that need to render graphics, play sounds, and load and process files, through to application frameworks like Qt. Emscripten has already been used to convert a very long list of real-world codebases to WebAssembly, including commercial codebases like the Unreal Engine 4 and the Unity engine. For examples and demos, see the community-maintained list on the wiki.

Emscripten generates small and fast code! Its default output format is WebAssembly , a highly optimizable executable format, that runs almost as fast as native code, while being portable and safe. Emscripten does a lot of optimization work for you automatically, by careful integration with LLVM, Binaryen, Closure Compiler, and other tools.

## WebAssembly 

WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

## Awesome WebAssembly Languages 

WebAssembly, or wasm for short, is a low-level bytecode format that runs in the browser just like JavaScript. It is designed to be faster to parse than JavaScript, as well as faster to execute which makes it a suitable compilation target for new and existing languages.

This repo contains a list of languages that currently compile to or have their VMs in WebAssembly(wasm)
